    <h1>Is Steven Capo Actually Vladamir Putin?</h1>

        <p>Who exactly is Steven Capo? This man, who has been pulling the strings behind the new <span class='underline'>Globalized World Government Organization</span> for years, is widely unknown. Could he actually be Russian President, and famed bear wrestler, Vladamir Putin? This site lays out the evidence for you the reader to decide.</p>

        <p>It is a widely known fact that Steven Capo and Vladamir Putin have never been photographed together. Is this just a happy coincidence? I think not. How could we possible know they are two distict people if they have never been seen side by side?</p>

    <h2>Exhibit 2:</h2>
    <div class='sec three'>
      <div class='text-wrapper1'>
        <p>When was Steven Capo born? It's well known that President Putin was born on October 7th, 1952. But what about Steven Capo? As it turns out, no one knows for sure. I sent a team of investigators to scour the Earth to find any evidence of his birth. This birth certificate is the only thing they could uncover. As you can see it states that Steven Capo was <span class='bold underline'>ALSO</span> born on the 7th of October, same as Mr. Putin. But notice that the parents and year of birth have been redacted. Suspicious? I think so.</p>
